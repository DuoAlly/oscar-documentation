# Using RStudio

RStudio is an IDE for R that can be run on Oscar.

## Launching RStudio

Open the Open On Demand Dashboard by following [this link](https://ood.ccv.brown.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/). Select RStudio (under "Default GUI's"). Fill in the form to allocate the required resources, and optionally select your R modules. Finally, click the "Launch Session" button.

## Known Issues

Plotting figures may not work within RStudio. If this is the case, save the plots to a file, and view them through the Open On Demand Desktop App. If plots are required for your task, launch RStudio through the Desktop App.
