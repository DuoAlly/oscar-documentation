3. Edit the `~/.ssh/config` file on your local machine, add the following lines. Replace `<username>` with your Oscar username. 

```text

 HostName oscar2
 User <username>
 ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p desktop.ccv.brown.edu
```

4.  In VSCode, select  **Remote-SSH: Connect to Hostâ€¦** and after the list populates select `oscar2`

{% hint style="info" %}
