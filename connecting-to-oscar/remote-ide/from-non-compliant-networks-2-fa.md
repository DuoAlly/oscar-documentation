# From Non-compliant Networks (2-FA)

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide is only for users connecting from Non-Brown Compliant Networks. 2-FA is mandatory.
{% endhint %}

To use VSCode you will need to be connected to the VPN. Please install the [Brown VPN client](https://vpn.brown.edu) before proceeding.

1. Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) for VSCode
2. Open VSCode settings&#x20;

* On Windows/Linux - **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings**
* On macOS - **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings**

Search for `symlink` and make sure the symlink searching is unchecked

3\. Make sure you have a working key-pair setup for passwordless authentication. If you don't have one setup please refer to this [documentation page](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/connecting-to-oscar/ssh/ssh-key-login-passwordless-ssh):

```
ssh-copy-id <username>@ssh.ccv.brown.edu
```

The public key will be automatically appended to the `authorized_keys` file on Oscar.&#x20;

4\. Under VSCode settings, search for <mark style="color:blue;">remote ssh timeout</mark> and manually enter a timeout value i.e. <mark style="color:blue;">50s</mark>. It should give you enough time to complete 2-Factor Authentication.

5\. Edit the `~/.ssh/config` file on your local machine, add the following lines. Replace `<username>` with your Oscar username.

```
# Jump box with public IP address
Host jump-box
  HostName ssh8.ccv.brown.edu
  User <username>
# Target machine with private IP address
Host login-node
  HostName oscar2
  User <username>
  ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p jump-box
```

6\. In VSCode, select  **Remote-SSH: Connect to Hostâ€¦** and after the list populates select `login-node`
