# Passwords

### What username and password should I be using?

* If you are at Brown and have requested a regular CCV account, your Oscar login can be authenticated using your Brown credentials itself, i.e. the same username and password that you use to login to any Brown service such as "canvas".&#x20;
* If you are an external user, you will have to get a sponsored ID at Brown through the department with which you are associated, before requesting an account on Oscar. Once you have the sponsored ID at Brown, you can [request an account](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0GtBE8kWJpmeG4B) on Oscar and use your Brown username and password to login.

### Changing Passwords

Oscar  users should use their Brown passwords to log into Oscar. Users should change their Brown passwords at [myaccount.brown.edu](https://myaccount.brown.edu).
