## Exploratory

Exploratory accounts are available to all members of the Brown community for free.

## HPC Priority\(+\)

HPC Priority accounts are available through a quarterly subscription and offer significantly more CPU cores, significantly more memory, and \(like all non-exploratory accounts\) double the maximum walltime available to exploratory accounts.

HPC Priority+ accounts offer twice the CPU cores and twice the memory of regular HPC Priority accounts and are also available through a quarterly subscription.

## Standard GPU Priority\(+\)

Standard GPU Priority accounts are available through a quarterly subscription and, while offering fewer CPU cores and less memory than an exploratory account, offer double the number of standard GPUs.

Standard GPU Priority+ accounts offer twice the memory and twice the number of standard GPUs of regular Standard GPU Priority accounts and are also available through a quarterly subscription.

## High End GPU Priority

High End GPU Priority accounts offer the same number of CPU as Standard GPU Priority and Standard GPU Priority\(+\) accounts and comparable memory as well as 4 High End \(Tesla V100\) GPUs. These accounts are available through a quarterly subscription.

## Large Memory Priority

Large Memory Priority accounts offer the same number of CPU cores as an exploratory account, 2 terabytes of memory, as well as double the exploratory maximum walltime. These accounts are available through a quarterly subscription.

## Condo

PIs who purchase hardware \(compute nodes\) for the CCV machine get a Condo account. Condo account users have the highest priority on the number of cores equivalent to the hardware they purchased. Condo accounts last for five years and give their owners access to 25% more CPU cores than they purchase for the first three years of their lifespan. Condo accounts are available through a single payment rather than a quarterly subscription.
