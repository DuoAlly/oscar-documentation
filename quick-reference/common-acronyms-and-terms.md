### Interactive Jobs

Jobs that allow the user to interact in real time with applications within Oscar, often from the command line. This differs from batch jobs in that each command to be run must be put in one at a time. \[[Related Page - Interactive Jobs](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/submitting-jobs/interact)]

### Modules

Modules are software components that can easily be loaded or unloaded into Oscar. For instance, a user can load the Python 3 module using a `module load` command. \[[Related Page - Using Modules](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/software/modules)]

### MPI

Stands for [Message Passing Interface](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/115/message-passing-interface-mpi).

### Open OnDemand (OOD)

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a web portal to the Oscar computing cluster. It can be used to launch a Desktop session on Oscar \[[Related Page - Open OnDemand](../connecting-to-oscar/open-ondemand/)]

### OOD app

OOD app is a web application  that runs on the Open OnDemand web portal. It allows users to launch interactive applications like Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Matlab or Desktop. \[[Related Page - Interactive Apps on OOD](../connecting-to-oscar/open-ondemand/interactive-apps-on-ood.md)]

### Partition

Partitions are essentially groupings of nodes that allocate resources for specific types of tasks. On Oscar, partitions are based on job submissions through the Slurm workload manager. \[[Related Page - Slurm Partitions](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/submitting-jobs/slurm)]

### PI

Stands for Principal Investigator. Mainly used to refer to the individual responsible for conducting and administrating a research grant. Within Oscar, PIs have their own data directories that can be shared to students. PIs may also purchase condos. \[[Related Page - Account Types](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/accounts-on-oscar/account-types)]
