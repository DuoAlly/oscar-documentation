Open OnDemand offers a browser-based terminal app to access Oscar. Windows users who do not want to install an SSH client like Putty will find this app very useful.

### Accessing the terminal

1. Log in to [https://ood.ccv.brown.edu](https://ood.ccv.brown.edu)
2. In the top menu, click `Clusters` -> `>_OSCAR Shell Access`

A new tab will open and the web-based terminal app will be launched in it.

### Features:

1. No installation needed. Just use your favorite browser!
2. No need to enter your password again. SSH into Oscar in seconds!
3. No need to use two factor authentication again. Just do it once, when you log into OOD.
4. Use it with, or without, VPN. Your workflow remains the same.
