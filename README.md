Welcome to the CCV Oscar User Manual. Oscar is Brown University's supercomputer.

This user manual assumes you already have an Oscar account. If you do not have an Oscar account, you can request one by filling and submitting a [new user account form](https://datasci.brown.edu/ccv-dev/services/infrastructure/oscar/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Anyone with a Brown account can get a free, exploratory account on Oscar.
{% endhint %}

Individuals external to Brown can get access to Oscar by having a sponsored Brown account. Please work with your department to get sponsored Brown accounts for any external collaborators.
