# Offboarding

## Account and Access

Oscar users will keep their access to Oscar as long as their Brown account are still active. To be able to access Oscar account after a user's Brown account is deactivated, the user needs to[ get an affiliate account](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/request-a-brown-account-for-an-affiliate) through the department the user is associated.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is the best that your affiliate account keeps the same username as your previous Brown account. Otherwise, please contact support@ccv.brown.edu to migrate your Oscar account to your affiliate account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not able to connect to Oscar with your affiliate account, please contact support@ccv.brown.edu for help.
{% endhint %}

## Data

### Data Retention

Your data (directories and files) will stay in Oscar for **one years** after your Brown account is deactivated. After that your data will be archived.&#x20;

### Date Deletion

You may delete your data when you leave Brown University. Or you may request that CCV delete your data on Oscar, especially if you have lots of data.

{% hint style="info" %}
A PI owns the PI's data directories and can delete all files there.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Retrieve Data

You can download data from Oscar following the instructions [here](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/managing-files/filetransfer). Globus is recommended for large data transfer.&#x20;
