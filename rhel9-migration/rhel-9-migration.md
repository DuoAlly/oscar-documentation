# RHEL-9 Migration

1. **What is the reason for this maintenance?**

Oscar's current operating system, RHEL-7, and its maintenance support phase will come to an end in June 2024. So Oscar is being upgraded to latest RedHat Enterprise Linux RHEL-9.2

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the new kernel and glibc majority of applications will break.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

2. **We are also introducing a bunch of new features:**

* **Upgraded OS -** Newer kernel and enhanced security patches
* **Power Saving Mode:** Idle nodes in batch partition enter power-saving mode (\~40W). And resume latency-performance mode before jobs start
* **GPU Direct Storage:** GDS enables a direct data path for direct memory access (DMA) transfers between GPU memory and storage, which avoids a bounce buffer through the CPU. This direct path increases system bandwidth and decreases the latency and utilization load on the CPU.
* **SLURM Upgrade:** We have tuned the scheduler to provide much higher throughput. Now supports `json` and `yaml` formatting for all slurm commands
* **SPACK & LMOD -** Newer industry standard for installing and managing applications on Oscar. We now support multple shells `bash,zsh & fish` etc
