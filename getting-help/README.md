# Getting Help

### Filing a Support Ticket

Filing a good support ticket makes it much easier for CCV staff to deal with your request

When you email `support@ccv.brown.edu` aim to include the following:

* State the problem/request in the subject of the email
* Describe which software and with version you are using
* Error message (if there was one)
* The job number
* How you were running, e.g.  batch, interactively, vnc
* Give as as small an example as possible that reproduces the problem

### Q\&A Forum

Ask questions and search for previous problems at our [OSCAR Question and Answer Forum](https://github.com/brown-ccv/oscar-documentation/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Office Hours

CCV holds weekly office hours. These are drop in sessions where we'll have one or more CCV staff members available to answer questions and help with any problems you have. Please visit [this page](https://events.brown.edu/ccv/all) for upcoming office hours and events.&#x20;

### Arrange a Meeting

You can arrange to meet with a CCV staff member in person to go over difficult problems, or to discuss how best to use Oscar. Email `support@ccv.brown.edu` to arrange a consultation.
