# Oscar Chatbot

Oscar Chatbot is an AI-powered assistant that answers questions from Oscar's documentation. It uses FAISS for indexing, Sentence Transformers for embeddings, and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 for generating responses. The project features a Flask backend and a JavaScript frontend styled with a GitBook-inspired design.
